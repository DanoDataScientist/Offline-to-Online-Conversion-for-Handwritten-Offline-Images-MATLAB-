# Offline-to-Online-Conversion-for-Handwritten-Offline-Images-MATLAB
Stroke Recovery of Offline Images is an import topic in the domain of document analysis and recognition. 

The folder 'Data' is contains a handwritten example image that is being converted to a online coordinate sequence for better recognition.

convert.m is the main code for the stroke recovery process
find_angles.m compute the angles for connected strokes at the junction-points
More Details about the implemented concepts are furnished in the the paper
